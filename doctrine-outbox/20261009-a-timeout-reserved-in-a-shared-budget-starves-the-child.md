## mlv-app/a-timeout-reserved-in-a-shared-budget-starves-the-child
rule: a scheduler that starts a child only while the shared per-beat budget still holds the child's FULL timeout has a start window of budget minus timeout. Keep the start threshold separate from the timeout, check the remaining budget before every launch, and give back (deferred, never a failure) a launch the budget would clip; persist deferred candidates and scan them first next beat.
mechanism: the board's key scheduler ran a 50 s beat and reserved the 45 s key-round timeout, so a round could start only in the first ~5 s. When the cheap work before it ran longer, the round was deferred every beat with no failure recorded: one pull request sat deferred 15+ min and was keyed by hand twice. Across 39 real keyed beats (round included) the time was min 4.6 s, median 10.8 s, max 51.4 s, and 33 were <= 20.9 s; the slowest four were rounds that ran to their timeout before any budget guard. The live fix set the start threshold to 20 s from the 33-of-39 figure. Distinct from the checkpoint-overshoot entry: that guard is too lax, this one too strict.
check: read the launch guard: the start threshold must sit below the child's timeout and cover a typical run (a threshold at the worst run cannot also be under the timeout). Run one beat with the budget nearly spent and expect a give-back with no failure counted, then a fresh beat that starts the child. Measured: before the fix one PR was deferred every beat; after it one scheduled beat keyed it in 6.9 s.
supersedes: none
evidence: measured
- **Guard:** none yet in tracked code (the scheduler is untracked board tooling; follow-up MECHKEYS-STARVE-LOOP-CAP-1). Residual risk: a round that persistently exceeds the start threshold now starves silently, so give-backs need a consecutive-count cap.
