## mlv-app/codex-0161-elevated-sandbox-setup-fails-on-an-in-use-node-repl
rule: on Codex 0.161.0 and later, a read-only Codex lane on Windows passes `-c windows.sandbox="unelevated"` per call, and a lane whose shell calls print "setup refresh had errors" is NOT RUN whatever verdict text it returned.
mechanism: from 0.161.0 the elevated Windows sandbox setup runs a runtime read/execute validation, which fails with "open ACL target for root-only update ... (os error 32)" on the node_repl.exe of the Codex Desktop runtime while another process holds it open. Setup then reports "setup refresh had errors" and every shell call in `exec -s read-only` fails. 0.160.1 passes the elevated control. The unelevated sandbox (a restricted token) passed the control in the same minute. Residual risk: weaker isolation than elevated, and network egress under it was not measured.
check: `codex sandbox -P :read-only -C <repo> -- git --version` exits 1 on 0.162.0 with Desktop open, and the same with `-c 'windows.sandbox="unelevated"'` exits 0; zero tokens
supersedes: none
